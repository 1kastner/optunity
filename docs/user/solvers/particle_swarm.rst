Particle Swarm Solver
======================

From Wikipedia_:

    PSO optimizes a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, 
    and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae. 
    The movements of the particles are guided by the best found positions in the search-space which 
    are updated as better positions are found by the particles.
