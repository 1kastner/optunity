Optunity can be installed as a typical Python package.

.. note::

    Optunity has soft dependencies on NumPy_ and SciPy_ 
    (for the :doc:`CMA-ES </user/solvers/CMA_ES>` and 
    :doc:`Nelder-Mead </user/solvers/nelder-mead>` solvers, respectively).
    Optunity additionally ships with DEAP, a library for evolutionary algorithms [DEAP2012]_.
