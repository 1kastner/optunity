Optimizing a simple 2D parabola
================================

In this example, we will use Optunity to optimize a very simple function, namely a two-dimensional parabola.

More specifically, the objective function is :math:`f(x, y) = -x^2 - y^2`.

The full code in Python::

    import optunity

    def f(x, y):
        return -x**2 - y**2

    optimal_pars, details, _ = optunity.maximize(f, num_evals=200, x=[-5, 5], y=[-5, 5])

For such simple functions we would use different solvers in practice, but the main idea remains.
