Optunity
===========

Optunity is a library containing various optimizers for hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter tuning is a recurrent problem in machine learning. Optunity
provides several distinct approaches to solve such problems.

For more information, please refer to the following pages:
https://github.com/claesenm/optunity/wiki

The Optunity library is implemented in Python and allows straightforward
integration in other machine learning environments, including R, MATLAB.

To get started with Optunity on Linux, issue the following commands::

    git clone https://github.com/claesenm/optunity.git
    echo "export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/optunity" >> ~/.bashrc

Afterwards, importing optunity should work in Python::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import optunity

Optunity is developed at the STADIUS lab of the dept. of electrical engineering
at KU Leuven (ESAT). Optunity is free software, using a BSD license.
